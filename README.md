## <center> **Market Basket Analysis on Online Retail Data** 
The "Market Basket Analysis on Online Retail Data" project aims to leverage advanced data analysis techniques to gain valuable insights into customer behavior for a UK-based online retail business. By examining transactional data spanning from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011, the project seeks to uncover patterns and associations among products purchased together. This analysis will provide actionable insights to enhance the company's in-store customer experience, improve customer loyalty and retention, maximize revenue and profitability, tailor marketing strategies, and optimize stock levels, ultimately leading to a more efficient and customer-focused retail operation.
